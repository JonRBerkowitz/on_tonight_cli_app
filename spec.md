# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application : I have a CLI that allows the user to view a list of TV shows with new episodes that are airing tonight.
- [x] Pull data from an external source : My app pulls data from (http://www.tvguide.com/new-tonight/)
- [x] Implement both list and detail views : My app gives the user a list of TV shows and then allows them to drill down to see the description of tonight's new episode.
